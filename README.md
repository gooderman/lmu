# lmu
lua + mongoose + unqlite

Lmu makes it possiable to create a websocket-based webapp by lua language. Lmu is designed for embedded linux, but it can also be build and run in other platforms, like win32. Lmu supports unqlite and json, an embedded NoSQL database, so it can create a normal webapp that support storage.
